			<li>1 cup lime juice</li>
			<li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
			<li>1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
			<li>&frac12; cup white sugar</li>
			<li>&frac12; fish sauce</li>
			<li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
			<li>1 stalk lemongrass, smashed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce</li>
			<li>1 &frac12; pounds (1-inch thick) steak fillet</li>
			<li>1 head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite sized pieces</li>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, green onions, lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Adjust the flavor, if desired, by adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.

			<li>
				Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. 
			</li>

			<li>
				Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
